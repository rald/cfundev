      <p class="indent">To April, thanks for being there for me on the lowest and saddest part of my life, and thanks for always helping me even though you are so far away and we barely know each other well. You will always be my little sister, my angel.</p>
      
      <p class="indent">To Joseph, thanks for everything, and for the good old days since the days when we are only in gradeschool, you make me laugh, you make me cry, you are always there for me, and thanks for the knowledge, advices, and everything. You will always be my bro, my bestfriend.</p>
